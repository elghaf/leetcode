why the solution of this is not availabel in this website

lets be honnest to prove this programming langage 
we need to understand the basics of this challange 
so you need to have work hard to imporve yourself to
find any solution to that sepecific project $so you 
have to initialise the codeing skills
so now lets imporove by hard work so none 
none of me want to understand that i have already fuck up 
so many time so we nned to understand the moste important thing
is that we need to improve my self 
sp we have to improve ist
